"""Evidence brief renderer for end-of-day app-idea synthesis.

Selects the top-N candidates from a Report by pipeline `final_score` and
renders them as a deterministic markdown brief. Classification (PAIN /
WILL-PAY / LAUNCH / WORKFLOW), ranking, and idea articulation all happen
downstream in the Claude Code synthesis call (see
`.github/workflows/daily-brief.yml`), which has the full text of every
candidate in context and reasons over it directly.

Pure-Python, no external API calls. Deterministic plumbing only —
judgment lives in the synthesis prompt.
